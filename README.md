# SHIT  
A mod to change the title of your game to something like this:

## How to use it  
Download the pak file in the release  
Place it in the mods folder  

## Why do you do this?  
I love this game bro, it holds fond memories of my high school days, but it hasn't been updated almost at all since it was released. It promised us a lot of gameplay mechanics that haven't been fulfilled to date, but now it's just a deadgame.  
I once saw a mod that functioned like this on steam's Workshop, but it didn't take long for it to disappear again, so I'm not going to post my homebrew version on Workshop because maybe someone will delete it  
I make this mod because it's shit and cool and I like that.  

## The picture in this caption is shit, it even has white borders.  
I used the 3d drawing that comes with windows and some AI magic, which took me a total of five minutes  
I hope you enjoy it.  
:)
